Iâ€™m going back in a few more times and we can see what happens when we go back home and then go back and get a new one for the next # Assignment 3: Drawing inference fof rom statistical models, and statistical power {#assignment3}

This assignment is set up as a statistical laboratory, we will perform simulations and your assignment is to interpret and explain the results. Create a report based on the code used in the lab and make sure you answer the specified questions (1-8). You can be as creative as you want and explore the results further. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

set.seed(1)
population <- rnorm(1000000, mean = 1.5, sd = 3)


samp1 <- data.frame(y = sample(population, 8, replace = FALSE))

samp2 <- data.frame(y = sample(population, 40, replace = FALSE))


m1 <- lm(y ~ 1, data = samp1)
m2 <- lm(y ~ 1, data = samp2)

summary(m1)
```
```{r}
mean(samp1$y)
coef(m1)
sd(samp1$y)
sd(samp1$y) /sqrt(8)
```
