               affects the precision of assessment of athletes, patients,
               clients and study participants. In this meta-analytic review we
               identify the most reliable measures of power and the factors
               affecting reliability. Our measures of reliability were the
               typical (standard) error of measurement expressed as a
               coefficient of variation (CV) and the percent change in the mean
               between trials. We meta-analysed these measures for power or
               work from 101 studies of healthy adults. Measures and tests with
               the smallest CV in exercise of a given duration include field
               tests of sprint running (approximately 0.9\%), peak power in an
               incremental test on a treadmill or cycle ergometer
               (approximately 0.9\%), equivalent mean power in a constant-power
               test lasting 1 minute to 3 hours on a treadmill or cycle
               ergometer (0.9 to 2.0\%), lactate-threshold power (approximately
               1.5\%), and jump height or distance (approximately 2.0\%). The
               CV for mean power on isokinetic ergometers was relatively large
               (> 4\%). CV were larger for nonathletes versus athletes (1.3 x),
               female versus male nonathletes (1.4 x), shorter (approximately
               1-second) and longer (approximately 1-hour) versus 1-minute
               tests ( 2 trials: the CV between the first 2 trials was 1.3
               times the CV between subsequent trials; performance also
               improved by 1.2\% between the first 2 trials but by only 0.2\%
               between subsequent trials. These findings should help exercise
               practitioners and researchers select or design good measures and
               protocols for tests of physical performance.",
