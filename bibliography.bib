              endurance. As such, training is associated with a potential
              interference effect. The present study randomized well-trained
              ice hockey players into a block periodization group (BP; n = 8),
              focusing on the development of either strength and power or
              endurance on a weekly, undulating basis, and a traditional group
              (TRAD; n = 8), performing a mixed training model, with
              simultaneous focus of strength, power, and endurance training
              every week. During the 6-week intervention, the two groups
              performed equal volumes and intensities of both strength, power,
              and endurance training. BP led to larger improvements than TRAD
              in knee extension peak torque at 180° s-1 (6.6 $\pm$ 8.7 vs

              0.05). There was also a trend toward larger improvements in BP
              than TRAD in peak torque in knee extension at 60° s-1 (2.1 $\pm$

               investigated the effect of block training periodization on
               maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) and parameters of exercise
               performance in elite junior alpine skiers. Six female and 15
               male athletes were assigned to high-intensity interval (IT, N =
               13) or control training groups (CT, N = 8). IT performed 15
               high-intensity aerobic interval (HIT) sessions in 11 days.
               Sessions were 4 x 4 min at 90-95\% of maximal heart rate
               separated by 3-min recovery periods. CT continued their
               conventionally mixed training, containing endurance and strength
               sessions. Before and 7 days after training, subjects performed a
               ramp incremental test followed by a high-intensity
               time-to-exhaustion (tlim) test both on a cycle ergometer, a 90-s
               high-box jump test as well as countermovement (CMJ) and squat
               jumps (SJ) on a force plate. IT significantly improved relative
               VO2max by 6.0\% (P < 0.01; male +7.5\%, female +2.1\%), relative
               peak power output by 5.5\% (P < 0.01) and power output at
               ventilatory threshold 2 by 9.6\% (P < 0.01). No changes occurred
               for these measures in CT. tlim remained unchanged in both
               groups. High-box jump performance was significantly improved in
               males of IT only (4.9\%, P < 0.05). Jump peak power (CMJ -4.8\%,
               SJ -4.1\%; P < 0.01), but not height decreased in IT only. For
               competitive alpine skiers, block periodization of HIT offers a
               promising way to efficiently improve VO2max and performance.
